# Prompt Intelligence Governance

## Purpose

This document governs how Prompt-Engineering-Guide material is absorbed into VCO.
The design principle is simple: prompt intelligence should increase quality and safety, not widen the prompt surface or create a second router.

## Plane Boundary

- `prompts.chat` and `prompt-asset-boost` = asset retrieval / candidate suggestion
- Prompt-Engineering-Guide assets = pattern cards + risk checklist + quality checks
- VCO router = single control plane

## Non-Redundancy Rules

1. Do not mirror Prompt-Engineering-Guide as a second searchable prompt library.
2. Do not create a second prompt workflow surface.
3. Do not expand `prompt_overlay` trigger keywords aggressively.
4. Keep PEG-derived assets in `references/` and governance docs.

## Quality Check Surface

Prompt candidates may optionally expose advisory-only metadata:
- `pattern_cards_used[]`
- `risk_flags[]`
- `checklist_pass_rate`

These fields are for human-readable quality signaling only.
They must not replace `selected.pack_id` or `selected.skill`.

## Rollout

- `shadow`: assets exist and quality checks may be emitted
- `soft`: higher-risk candidates can be converted into confirmation prompts
- `strict`: can require the presence of quality metadata, but still cannot become a router
