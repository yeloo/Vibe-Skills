## Cleanup-First Canonical Run Order

1. 触及 version / packaging / install / frontmatter 时，先跑 runtime integrity 家族 gate。
2. 每个 canonical 批次收口后，必跑 cleanliness / outputs / mirror hygiene 家族 gate。
3. 根据本次变更所属治理域，补跑对应 plane / overlay / capability / release family gate。
4. 只有在 planning board、promotion、release evidence 变化时，才补 closure / release-train / promotion gates。

## Fixture Taxonomy

- **Wave28 canonical pilot fixtures**: `fixtures/pilot-memory.json`, `fixtures/pilot-prompt.json`, `fixtures/pilot-browserops.json`, `fixtures/pilot-desktopops.json`. These are the only pilot inputs consumed by `vibe-pilot-scenarios.ps1` and referenced by `config/promotion-board.json`.
- **Gate-only mock fixtures**: `fixtures/prompt-asset-boost.mock.json` and `fixtures/llm-acceleration.mock.json`. They exist only to support their corresponding mock-provider gates and are not pilot assets.
- **Deprecated shadow fixtures**: legacy `*-shadow.json` pilot-name variants are intentionally removed from the active fixture set to prevent canonical/shadow naming ambiguity.

### Quick Start (Wave40-63)

Run the runtime-hardening gate first, then the Wave40-63 governance closure gates:

```powershell
& ".\\vibe-bom-frontmatter-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\\vibe-wave40-63-board-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\\vibe-capability-dedup-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\\vibe-adaptive-routing-readiness-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\\vibe-upstream-value-ops-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Related rollout utility:

- `..\governance\set-openspec-rollout.ps1`: stage switch helper for `off | shadow | soft-lxl-planning | strict-lxl-planning`.
- `..\governance\publish-openspec-soft-rollout.ps1`: single-command soft rollout with precheck -> switch -> postcheck. Automatic rollback is disabled; failures emit manual rollback command and require explicit user confirmation.
- `..\governance\set-gsd-overlay-rollout.ps1`: GSD-Lite overlay stage switch helper for `off | shadow | soft-lxl-planning | strict-lxl-planning`.

## Quick Start (Retro Checks)

Run context retro smoke + deterministic matrix:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-context-retro-smoke.ps1"
& ".\vibe-retro-context-regression-matrix.ps1"
& ".\vibe-retro-safety-gate.ps1"
```

## Quick Start (Routing Stability Gate)

Run default gate (recommended first pass):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-routing-stability-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Run strict gate (after default gate is passing consistently):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-routing-stability-gate.ps1" -Strict -WriteArtifacts
```

Run config parity gate (main vs bundled):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-config-parity-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Run version consistency gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-version-consistency-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Run version + packaging governance gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-version-packaging-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Run repo cleanliness gate (local hygiene first):

```powershell
& ".\..\governance\install-local-worktree-excludes.ps1"
& ".\vibe-repo-cleanliness-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-output-artifact-boundary-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Run installed runtime freshness gate (canonical repo only):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-installed-runtime-freshness-gate.ps1" -TargetRoot "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex" -WriteReceipt
```

Notes:
- `vibe-version-consistency-gate.ps1`, `vibe-version-packaging-gate.ps1`, `vibe-config-parity-gate.ps1`, `release-cut.ps1`, and `sync-bundled-vibe.ps1` are protected by the execution-context lock and must run from the canonical repo tree.
- Runtime freshness is a separate post-install governance layer; it does not replace repo parity gates.
- Installed-runtime directory comparisons inherit `packaging.allow_bundled_only`, so intentionally packaged bundled-only files remain allowed after install.
- `check.ps1` / `check.sh` now verify the runtime freshness receipt and invoke the freshness gate when canonical repo execution is available.
- In shell-only environments without `pwsh`, `check.sh` warns and skips authoritative runtime freshness execution instead of emitting a false receipt hard-fail.

Run OpenSpec governance gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-openspec-governance-gate.ps1"
```

Run GSD overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-gsd-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Prompt overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-prompt-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Memory governance trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-memory-governance-gate.ps1"
```

Run Data scale overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-data-scale-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run LLM acceleration overlay trigger gate (mock provider):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-llm-acceleration-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Retrieval overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-retrieval-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Exploration overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-exploration-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Quality debt overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-quality-debt-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Framework interop overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-framework-interop-gate.ps1"
```

Run ML lifecycle overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-ml-lifecycle-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run Python clean-code overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-python-clean-code-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run System design overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-system-design-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run CUDA kernel overlay trigger gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-cuda-kernel-overlay-gate.ps1"
```

Run observability gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-observability-gate.ps1"
```

```powershell
& ".\vibe-heartbeat-gate.ps1"
```

Run scientific pack probe (pack-focused route study):

```powershell
& ".\probe-scientific-packs.ps1" -DefaultIncludePrompt
```

Run route probe research matrix (engineering report):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-routing-probe-research.ps1" -DefaultIncludePrompt
```

Run Deep Discovery gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-deep-discovery-gate.ps1"
```

Run Deep Discovery scenarios:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-deep-discovery-scenarios.ps1" -Mode shadow
& ".\vibe-deep-discovery-scenarios.ps1" -Mode soft
& ".\vibe-deep-discovery-scenarios.ps1" -Mode strict
```

Run router contract gate:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-router-contract-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Keep generated fixture files for manual inspection:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-data-scale-overlay-gate.ps1" -KeepFixtures
```

Compare two CER reports and emit delta artifacts:

```powershell
& ".\cer-compare.ps1" `
  -BaselineCerPath "..\..\outputs\retro\cer\baseline.json" `
  -CurrentCerPath "..\..\outputs\retro\cer\current.json" `
  -OutputMarkdownPath "..\..\outputs\retro\compare\delta.md" `
  -OutputJsonPath "..\..\outputs\retro\compare\delta.json" `
  -UpdateCurrentComparison
```

Interpretation:
- `fallback_rate` delta < 0 is better.
- `stability` delta > 0 is better.
- `context_pressure` delta < 0 is better.
- `route_gap` delta > 0 usually means better route separability.

  -SourceRoot "..\..\third_party\system-prompts-mirror" `
  -OutputPath "..\..\outputs\external-corpus\prompt-signals.json"

& "..\research\generate-vco-suggestions.ps1" `
  -SignalPath "..\..\outputs\external-corpus\prompt-signals.json" `
  -SourceRoot "..\..\third_party\system-prompts-mirror" `
  -OutputDirectory "..\..\outputs\external-corpus"

& ".\vibe-external-corpus-gate.ps1" `
  -CandidateSkillIndexPath "..\..\outputs\external-corpus\skill-keyword-index.candidate.json" `
  -RunExistingSmoke
```

For strict CI mode (smoke errors block merge):

```powershell
& ".\vibe-external-corpus-gate.ps1" `
  -CandidateSkillIndexPath "..\..\outputs\external-corpus\skill-keyword-index.candidate.json" `
  -RunExistingSmoke `
  -FailOnSmokeError
```

```

Output artifacts:
- `outputs/learn/vibe-adaptive-suggestions.json`
- `outputs/learn/vibe-adaptive-suggestions.md`

## Wave19-30 Governance Gates

新增的 Wave19-30 门禁如下：

```powershell
& ".\vibe-ecosystem-absorption-contract-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-memory-tier-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-mem0-backend-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-letta-contract-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-prompt-intelligence-assets-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-browserops-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-desktopops-shadow-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-cross-plane-conflict-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-promotion-board-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-pilot-scenarios.ps1"
```

建议执行顺序：
1. admission / memory / prompt 基础 gates
2. browser / desktop / conflict gates
3. promotion board / pilot gates
4. config parity / version packaging gates


## Wave19-30 Absorption Gates

Run ecosystem admission and new four-plane governance gates:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-ecosystem-absorption-contract-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-memory-tier-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-mem0-backend-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-letta-contract-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-prompt-intelligence-assets-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-browserops-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-desktopops-shadow-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-cross-plane-conflict-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-promotion-board-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-pilot-scenarios.ps1"
```

Recommended sequence for Wave29-30 packaging closure:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-config-parity-gate.ps1"
& ".\vibe-version-packaging-gate.ps1"
```

## Wave31-33 Governance Gates

Mirror topology and runtime coherence additions:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-nested-bundled-parity-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-mirror-edit-hygiene-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-release-install-runtime-coherence-gate.ps1" -TargetRoot "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex" -WriteArtifacts
```

Operational notes:

- `vibe-nested-bundled-parity-gate.ps1` is the blocking gate for `nested_bundled` drift.
- `vibe-mirror-edit-hygiene-gate.ps1` is intended for dirty-tree / PR hygiene; it may fail while mirror sync is intentionally pending.
- `vibe-release-install-runtime-coherence-gate.ps1` checks the config + docs + install/check script contract for release/install/runtime boundaries.
- `check.ps1` and `check.sh` invoke runtime freshness and coherence; they do **not** invoke mirror edit hygiene by default.
- runtime freshness and coherence stay authoritative only when the scripts run from the canonical repo root.

## Wave34-39 Governance Gates

Upstream corpus / productization / release-closure additions:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-upstream-corpus-manifest-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-upstream-mirror-freshness-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-docling-contract-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-connector-admission-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-role-pack-governance-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-capability-catalog-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-promotion-board-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
& ".\vibe-pilot-scenarios.ps1"
& ".\vibe-deep-extraction-pilot-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```

Operational notes:

- `vibe-upstream-corpus-manifest-gate.ps1` and `vibe-upstream-mirror-freshness-gate.ps1` together define the 15-project corpus baseline plus runtime mirror freshness evidence.
- `vibe-docling-contract-gate.ps1`, `vibe-connector-admission-gate.ps1`, `vibe-role-pack-governance-gate.ps1`, and `vibe-capability-catalog-gate.ps1` validate that absorbed value lands as governance/product surfaces rather than second execution owners.
- `vibe-promotion-board-gate.ps1` is the bridge from Wave31-38 governance assets into Wave39 release evidence; it should be part of release-cut, not an optional afterthought.
- `vibe-pilot-scenarios.ps1` covers the execution-plane fixtures plus `pilot-deep-extraction.json`; `vibe-deep-extraction-pilot-gate.ps1` is the release-closure rollup gate.

## Quick Start (Wave64-82)

Run the Wave64-82 gate chain after the prior runtime / Wave40-63 gates are green:

```powershell
& ".\vibe-wave64-82-closure-gate.ps1" -WriteArtifacts
```
